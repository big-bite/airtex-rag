MC_T000995752-20302P01.pdf,,,S690Q,yes,Symilar,"""The material code """"S355JR"""" was not found in the document. However, a similar material code """"S355J2H"""" was found. The difference between """"S355JR"""" and """"S355J2H"""" lies in their impact test requirements and specific applications:

S355JR: This grade has a minimum yield strength of 355 MPa and is suitable for general structural applications. It requires a Charpy V-notch impact test at room temperature (20°C) with a minimum energy of 27 Joules.

S355J2H: This grade also has a minimum yield strength of 355 MPa but is used for hollow sections and requires a Charpy V-notch impact test at a lower temperature (-20°C) with a minimum energy of 27 Joules.

Here is the relevant excerpt from the document:

Steel grade S355J2H Z3
This material code """"S355J2H"""" is listed under the materials category in your provided list[1]."""
